Here you are able to find our rules:

1. Members should not carry out attacks against other alliances without the prior consent of the alliance leadership or during specified events, such as the desert event or against VS opponents.

2. Every member should be active at least once every seven days and have been online at least once on Fridays or inform the leadership of any absence.

3. To get alliance points, it is necessary to support alliance research and to press the help button that appears at the bottom right to help speed up the other players in the game. With these points you can buy accelerators, golden shards and other goodies and gifts, but you can also get a cheap 24-hour shield here.

4. The alliance is committed to supporting attacks from our allies ERAD "The Walking Beer". In return, we also expect support.

5. Trucks and secret missions in our own state (926) are prohibited. Offenses will be punished from next Monday by the conductor event. There will be no more expulsions for the time being. Nevertheless, "the offenders or repeat offenders will be excluded from the conductor and train event for a week. This serves the players who follow the rules as well as the community to avoid future problems with other alliances and is intended to relieve the leadership as well as the R4 and the feeling of the game, as the R5 and R4 hardly get to play anymore because they are mainly confronted with rule violations. In plain language, this means that the conductor does not select any rule breakers to ride along and no one who has broken the rules will be considered in the dice event.

6. In the event of disputes, the "war god" or "boss" makes the final decision with special (double) voting rights. The aim is always to achieve a majority decision (adjusted to attendance) by R4. (At least 5 votes that are of the same opinion or boss with 2 others. However, if time is a significant factor, the boss or appointed representative can make a decision in favor of the alliance themselves. After the incident, it is also essential to exchange information with the leadership about why and then to inform the alliance about the procedure in order to ensure transparency as to why the expulsion was/is justified.

:warning: In the event of a serious violation of generally known law in relation to insulting, harassing or threatening other players, they will inevitably be kicked with a screenshot and will be completely banned as alliance members and placed on the "black list".

7. Every member must give themselves a suitable name by the end of the month to ensure clear identification: Commandant124353 or Commander 1625268 are difficult to tell apart and must therefore be changed.

8. Meetings should be limited to one minute. Questions can be asked in the alliance chat.

9. Event points should be used on the optimal days in order to achieve the greatest benefit for the alliance. During the week (Monday to Saturday) the focus is on the VS duel, which has a higher priority during this time. If you have any questions about this, R4 and 5 are ready to answer them.

10. Every member must activate a sign from 11 p.m. on Friday. If no activity is planned for Saturday, you must choose a sign with 24 hours.

11. All members of the alliance should meet at the alliance meeting place within a week. Otherwise, meetings or events are not possible.

12. The following applies on all days except Saturday:

* Report: If you are attacked, report this immediately to R4.
* Alliance meeting: The attacked player can call an alliance meeting against the attacker. This is only available to the player who suffered the attack.
* Defense: All other members support the attacked member as far as they can by sending a garrison to their base. Additional attacks are prohibited unless Commandment 6 decides otherwise. Support is provided solely by sending reinforcements.
* NAP 15 is to be prevented from attacking in principle.

13. Anyone who repeatedly fails to comply with the commandments will be placed at the lowest rank and removed from the alliance after 2 days by the R5 and only by him. With an explanation to the alliance and the person who is thrown out. Re-entry is only possible with prior mutual agreement.

14. Spending: Spending real money is up to each individual; this is neither viewed negatively nor encouraged. It serves the individual and only him. No member is obliged to spend money. Should another member pressure or demand it, they should
