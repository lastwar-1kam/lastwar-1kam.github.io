Here you are able to find our rules:

1. Members should not carry out attacks against other alliances without the prior consent of the alliance leadership or during specified events, such as the desert event or against VS opponents.

2. Every member should be active at least once every seven days and have been online at least once on Fridays or inform the leadership of any absence.

3. To get alliance points, it is necessary to support alliance research and to press the help button that appears at the bottom right to help speed up the other players in the game. With these points you can buy accelerators, golden shards and other goodies and gifts, but you can also get a cheap 24-hour shield here.

4. The alliance is committed to supporting attacks from our allies ERAD "The Walking Beer". In return, we also expect support.

5. Trucks and secret missions may only be plundered on other servers. In the event of a violation, the perpetrator must provide the injured party with a truck manned by a small troop. If this rule is violated several times, the alliance reserves the right to remove this player from the alliance, as these actions damage the entire alliance.

6. In the event of disputes, the "God of War, Administrator" or boss makes the final decision. Time should also be a decisive factor due to the special position. In all other matters, the alliance is decided by majority vote by R4. The simple majority of those present applies, but at least 5 votes. The boss and the named representatives are granted special rights to lead the alliance for situations that have not yet been named, including:

* Removing members from the alliance
* Controlling war events
* Canceling or starting events
* Promoting or warning members
* Moving members up the ranks

All of the points mentioned must be explained after the alliance has been completed.

:warning: In the event of a serious violation of generally known law in relation to insulting, harassing or threatening other players, they will inevitably be kicked with a screenshot and will be completely banned as alliance members and placed on the "black list".

7. Every member must give themselves a suitable name by the end of the month to ensure clear identification: Commandant124353 or Commander 1625268 are difficult to tell apart and must therefore be changed.

8. Meetings should be limited to one minute. Questions can be asked in the alliance chat.

9. Event points should be used on the optimal days in order to achieve the greatest benefit for the alliance. During the week (Monday to Saturday) the focus is on the VS duel, which has a higher priority during this time. If you have any questions about this, R4 and 5 are ready to answer them.

10. Every member must activate a sign from 11 p.m. on Friday. If no activity is planned for Saturday, you must choose a sign with 24 hours.

11. All members of the alliance should meet at the alliance meeting place within a week. Otherwise, meetings or events are not possible.

12. The following applies on all days except Saturday:

* Report: If you are attacked, report this immediately to R4.
* Alliance meeting: The attacked player can call an alliance meeting against the attacker. This is only available to the player who suffered the attack.
* Defense: All other members support the attacked member as far as they can by sending a garrison to their base. Additional attacks are prohibited unless Commandment 6 decides otherwise. Support is provided solely by sending reinforcements.
* NAP 15 is to be prevented from attacking in principle.

13. Anyone who repeatedly fails to comply with the commandments will be placed at the lowest rank and removed from the alliance after 2 days by the R5 and only by him. With an explanation to the alliance and the person who is thrown out. Re-entry is only possible with prior mutual agreement.

14. Spending: Spending real money is up to each individual; this is neither viewed negatively nor encouraged. It serves the individual and only him. No member is obliged to spend money. Should another member pressure or demand it, they should

15. At least 5M points in VS per week

16. At least 15k donation points in Allianz Technology per week
