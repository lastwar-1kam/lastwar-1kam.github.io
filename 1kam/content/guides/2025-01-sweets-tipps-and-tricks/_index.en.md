## Defeat strong monsters with almost no losses

If you have too many losses to defeat too strong monsters in order to get a kill bonus, for example, there is the following great option.

- Configure one of your squads so that it only consists of a single, very weak unit
- Ask our helpful strong members for help in the chat
- Start a rally against your monster with the previously configured squad

Voila. This means you have almost no units with you and the strong friends will defeat the monster.
