## Defeat strong monsters with almost no losses

If you have too many losses to defeat too strong monsters in order to get a kill bonus, for example, there is the following great option.

- Configure one of your squads so that it only consists of a single, very weak unit
- Ask our helpful strong members for help in the chat
- Start a rally against your monster with the previously configured squad

Voila. This means you have almost no units with you and the strong friends will defeat the monster.

## Daily ToDos

- In the VS arena, give 3 thumbs up in both areas (30 thumbs each)
- do daily tasks (bottom left, walkie talkie)
- click the VIP symbol, pick up the box for VIP points in the top right and the daily freebies in the middle
- click on the diamond shop at the top right, open the free box for the daily sale and weekly pass
- Season 1 field on the right, then Season Battle Pass, complete daily tasks
- morning + evening: research Alliance Techs
- morning + evening (24h durability) pick up Alliance Gifts
- if active: look for daily tasks in hot deals (almost at the top right)
- attack code monsters (events, then far back) 3* when spawned
